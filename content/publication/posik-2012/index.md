abstract: 'Four methods for global numerical black box optimization with origins in
  the mathematical programming community are described and experimentally compared
  with the state of the art evolutionary method, BIPOP-CMA-ES. The methods chosen
  for the comparison exhibit various features that are potentially interesting for
  the evolutionary computation community: systematic sampling of the search space
  (DIRECT, MCS) possibly combined with a local search method (MCS), or a multi-start
  approach (NEWUOA, GLOBAL) possibly equipped with a careful selection of points to
  run a local optimizer from (GLOBAL). The recently proposed “comparing continuous
  optimizers” (COCO) methodology was adopted as the basis for the comparison. Based
  on the results, we draw suggestions about which algorithm should be used depending
  on the available budget of function evaluations, and we propose several possibilities
  for hybridizing evolutionary algorithms (EAs) with features of the other compared
  algorithms.'
