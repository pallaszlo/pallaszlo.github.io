abstract: The multistart clustering global optimization method called GLOBAL has been
  introduced in the 1980s for bound constrained global optimization problems with
  black-box type objective function. Since then the technological environment has
  been changed much. The present paper describes shortly the revisions and updates
  made on the involved algorithms to utilize the novel technologies, and to improve
  its reliability. We discuss in detail the results of the numerical comparison with
  the old version and with C-GRASP, a continuous version of the GRASP method. According
  to these findings, the new version of GLOBAL is both more reliable and more efficient
  than the old one, and it compares favorably with C-GRASP too.
