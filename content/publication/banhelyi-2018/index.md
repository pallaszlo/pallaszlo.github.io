abstract: This book explores the updated version of the GLOBAL algorithm which contains
  improvements for a local search algorithm and new Java implementations. Efficiency
  comparisons to earlier versions and on the increased speed achieved by the parallelization,
  are detailed. Examples are provided for students as well as researchers and practitioners
  in optimization, operations research, and mathematics to compose their own scripts
  with ease. A GLOBAL manual is presented in the appendix to assist new users with
  modules and test functions.   GLOBAL is a successful stochastic multistart global
  optimization algorithm that has passed several computational tests, and is efficient
  and reliable for small to medium dimensional global optimization problems. The algorithm
  uses clustering to ensure efficiency and is modular in regard to the two local search
  methods it starts with, but it can also easily apply other local techniques. The
  strength of this algorithm lies in its reliability and adaptive algorithm parameters.
  The GLOBAL algorithm is free to download also in the earlier Fortran, C, and MATLAB
  implementations.
