abstract: 'Multi Level Single Linkage (MLSL) is a well known stochastic global optimization
  method. In this paper, a new hybrid variant (HMLSL) of the MLSL algorithm is presented.
  The most important improvements are related to the sampling phase: the sample is
  generated from a Sobol quasi-random sequence and a few percent of the population
  is further improved by using crossover and mutation operators like in a traditional
  differential evolution (DE) method. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance
  of the new HMLSL algorithm on the testbed of 24 noiseless functions. The new algorithm
  is also compared against a simple MLSL and a traditional DE in order to identify
  the benefits of the applied improvements. The results confirm that the HMLSL outperforms
  the MLSL and DE methods. The new method has a larger probability of success and
  usually is faster especially in the final stage of the optimization than the other
  two algorithms.'
