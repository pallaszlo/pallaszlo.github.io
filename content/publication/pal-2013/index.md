abstract: Multi Level Single Linkage is a multistart, stochastic global optimization
  method which relies on random sampling and local search. In this paper, we benchmarked
  three variants of the MLSL algorithm by using two gradient based and a derivative-free
  local search method on the noiseless function testbed. The three methods were also
  compared with a commercial multistart solver, called OQNLP (OptQuest/NLP). Our experiment
  showed that, the results may be influenced essentially by the applied local search
  procedure. Depending of the type of the problem the gradient based local search
  methods are faster in the initial stage of the optimization, while the derivative-free
  method show a superior performance in the final phase for moderate dimensions. Considering
  the percentage of the solved problems, OQNLP is similar or even better (for multi-modal
  and weakly structured functions) in 5-D than the MLSL method equipped with the gradient
  type local search methods, while on 20-D the latter algorithms are usually more
  faster.
