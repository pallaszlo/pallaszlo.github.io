 abstract = {The covariance matrix is an important element of many asset
allocation strategies. The widely used sample covariance matrix estimator is
unstable especially when the number of time observations is small and the
number of assets is large or when high-dimensional data is involved in the
computation. In this study, we focus on the most important estimators that
are applied on a group of Markowitz-type strategies and also on a recently
introduced method based on hierarchical tree clustering. The performance
tests of the portfolio strategies using different covariance matrix estimators
rely on the out-of-sample characteristics of synthetic and real stock data.},
