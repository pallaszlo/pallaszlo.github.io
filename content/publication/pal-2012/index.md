abstract: GLOBAL is a multi-start type stochastic method for bound constrained global
  optimization problems. Its goal is to find the best local minima that are potentially
  global. For this reason it involves a combination of sampling, clustering, and local
  search. The role of clustering is to reduce the number of local searches by forming
  groups of points around the local minimizers from a uniformly sampled domain and
  to start few local searches in each of those groups. We evaluate the performance
  of the GLOBAL algorithm on the BBOB 2009 noiseless testbed, containing problems
  which reflect the typical difficulties arising in real-world applications. The obtained
  results are also compared with those obtained form the simple multi-start procedure
  in order to analyze the effects of the applied clustering rule. An improved parameterization
  is introduced in the GLOBAL method and the performance of the new procedure is compared
  with the performance of the MATLAB GlobalSearch solver by using the BBOB 2010 test
  environment.
