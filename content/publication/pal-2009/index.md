abstract: We describe a new implementation of an interval optimization algorithm with
  focus on the software related issues. The algorithm implemented in MATLAB that uses
  the INTLAB package supporting interval calculations and automatic differentiation
  solves the bound constrained global optimization problem. The method itself is a
  simplified version of those interval techniques much investigated in the past, that
  was first developed from the global optimization algorithm of the Numerical Toolbox
  for Verified Computing. According to the numerical studies completed, the new INTLAB-based
  implementation is closely as efficient as its C-XSC-based basis algorithm – with
  the exception of the CPU time needed (the longer computations are due to the interpreter
  nature of MATLAB).
