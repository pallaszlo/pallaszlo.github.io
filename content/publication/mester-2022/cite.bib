 abstract = {There are many suitable global optimization approaches to find the minimum value
of an objective function. In this paper, the improvement of the GLOBAL Optimization Method
is studied, which is based on stochastic clustering. Through its three main components, which
are sampling, clustering, and local search the algorithm aims to find the global minimum of
the objective function. Local search methods significantly influence the efficiency of the
GLOBAL method. The efficiency of our proposal may be improved by dividing the system
into modules and by creating new variants of both the local and line search methods.
The main contribution of this work is to show the achievements of modularization and the
efficiency of the new variants of both local and line search methods.},
