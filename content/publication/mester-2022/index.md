abstract: There are many suitable global optimization approaches to find the minimum
  value of an objective function. In this paper, the improvement of the GLOBAL Optimization
  Method is studied, which is based on stochastic clustering. Through its three main
  components, which are sampling, clustering, and local search the algorithm aims
  to find the global minimum of the objective function. Local search methods significantly
  influence the efficiency of the GLOBAL method. The efficiency of our proposal may
  be improved by dividing the system into modules and by creating new variants of
  both the local and line search methods. The main contribution of this work is to
  show the achievements of modularization and the efficiency of the new variants of
  both local and line search methods.
