abstract: We compare several nested fixed point and optimization procedures for computing
  the estimator of the widely-used empirical market demand model developed by Berry
  et al. (1995). It is well-known that the optimization may often lead to multiple
  local optima, which, if ignored, can lead to erroneous policy conclusions. By combining
  the frequencies of finding the global minima and the computing times, we propose
  a new indicator that provides the computing time needed for obtaining the global
  minima. Using this indicator, we find that the Spectral and Squarem methods (Reynaerts
  et al., 2012) outperform the benchmark contraction iterations method and the MPEC
  (Dubé et al., 2012) and ABLP (Lee and Seo, 2015) methods. Moreover, when the share
  of the outside alternative is relatively large, two derivative-free optimization
  algorithms, which require less calculations and coding than derivative-based algorithms,
  outperform the best derivative-based methods. A simple argument suggests that the
  latter statement is likely to be true for other versions of the model as well.
